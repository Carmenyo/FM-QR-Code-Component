## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflows


### What I learned

This challenge merely reiterated a few concepts of css mainly how to position an image to the top of a container using the css property.
Also I have been practising with Pureref (https://www.pureref.com) and BEM terminology
